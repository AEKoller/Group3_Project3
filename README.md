# Group3_Project3
This project seeks to investigate the correlation between crime rates and unemployment. To accomplish this, we will be utilizing various governmental datasets to create interactive maps to view rates of various offenses and employment rates within the same time frames. We will be attempting to use around twenty years of data within these datasets.
